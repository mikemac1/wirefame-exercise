## Comments & Reflections Lab 08a

* How did this go, overall?
Not too bad. Although Sheyna did most of the main portion the color transition was pretty easy and the header between the nav and the unordered list was really the only tricky piece. Once I figured out to treat the unordered list itself as a flex container then it was just utilizing the cheatsheet to get what was needed.  A good lab in the sense of, not that it was easy but once I created borders for everything it was very distinct how the developer can see how flexbox affects the items in the container.

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
Flexbox definitely has its quirks when you are working from within another flex container.  Playing with the margins I was able to align the nav items such that they were inline with the lettering of the in-place logo.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
It took me a little over 90 minutes to complete and expected to go about 2 hours so this is on par.  Definitely would have taken longer if I had used my original idea of sectioning the three inner images in the main section. However watching Sheyna demo for class it was obvious it was not needed.
